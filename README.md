The Employee Salary Management System project is a software application designed to help organizations manage their employee salary records. This project is built using the Java programming language and the Swing framework, which allows for the creation of user-friendly graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
The main goal of this project is to provide a simple and intuitive interface for HR or finance departments to manage employee salary records. The application allows users to insert, delete, and update employee records, as well as view a list of all employees and their corresponding salary details.
